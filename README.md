# Unit #2 - *Concentration*

**Concentration** is a web app game where players match colors in a 16 square grid. This project demonstrates my understanding of client-side JavaScript to build dynamic web pages.

Submitted by: **Tejal Patel**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Website is dynamic. It can be viewed finely with all mobile devices
* [x] Built the game UI using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
* [x] Implemented the game logic with client-side JavaScript
* [x] Manipulated the DOM using client-side JavaScript

<!-- The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Added 
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing. -->
